<!--
Create a 5 x 5 grid of blue blocks. When a block is clicked it turns red. Its adjacent block turns green.
If a red block is on the end of a row, the adjacent green block is on the line below on the first column, 
et cetera. When another block is clicked, the previous red/green blocks go back to blue. There will only
ever be one red and one green block on the screen, the rest are always blue.
Only worry about Chrome. 
------ 
I solved this without javascript by making use of infinite transitions to preserve state. Kind of a fun hack
 :) The only edge case is the bottom right block and getting the adjacent green block to appear on the top 
left block. Right now it only shows up temporarily (on :active). I think there may be a way to register a 
keyframe to get it to stay.
